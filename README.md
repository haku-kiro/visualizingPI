# visualizingPI

I saw this post https://public.tableau.com/views/VisualizingPi/pi?:embed=y&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no 
And decided to create a 'less' apealing copy using c# (visually at least).

You can specify any number from 1 to 1,000,000 and it will return the amount of times 1-9 appears, as well as their percentages based
on the number you entered as the total.

The inspiration is from this reddit post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5zdt75/math_is_every_digit_in_pi_equally_likely/

If you'd like to just download the pi text file (that contains the million digits of pi) that I used, it is located at:
visualizingPI/visualizingPI/bin/Debug/piMillion.txt

The source I used to get this text file is:
http://www.angio.net/pi/

They provide various downloads for specific lengths of pi as well as some cool uses of this data, be sure to check them out.
